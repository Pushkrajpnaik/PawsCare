# PawsCare

This is an Animal Adoption App, currently in the works for the PawsCare Animal Resq NGO. It’s for anyone who wants to adopt a pet, put pets up for adoption, promote adoption, or just enjoy looking at adorable animal pics cause who doesn’t love these cuties?

Once the app is ready, you’ll be able to post pets for adoption and even adopt animals yourself. PawsCare acts as a go-between, reviewing applications and being the main point of contact.

The app also has a community page where you can share pet stories, ask questions, or post about any concerns you have.
